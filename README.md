# SnapLingua: Learn a Language through passive browsing!

Snaplingua is a full-fledged language learning system meant to supercharge flashcard creation and review. Our Chrome extension allows the user to highlight any word on a screen and create a flashcard with a feshly generated sentence at any desired complexity level, using DALL-E and GPT models! These flashcards are then reviewable on our app, allowing you to review new vocabulary in any downtime you may have throughout the day!

A demo of our project can be found below:
